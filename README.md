# ML Algorithms using only Python and numpy

Machine learning algorithms implemented using only python and numpy. the code will come with through implemetation of the algorithm and the main idea behind the algorithm. All the code and their corresponding outputs are in jupyter notebook for easy reference and learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

For new users, we highly recommend [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

### Installing

After installing anaconda open the terminal and type the following commands

```
conda --version
```

it will show the conda version installed. Congratulations you have successfully installed the Anaconda

To create a new environment write the following commands in the terminal

Note: the name of the environment is py35, you may change it if you want.

```
conda create --name py35 python=3.5
```

After environment is successfully created, to enter into the environment use the following commands

```
use py35(your environment name)
```

To install jupyter notebook

```
pip3 install jupyter notebook
```

Congratulations you have successfully installed the Jupyter notebook in your environment.

To run the code download or clone this repository and open the repo in jupyter notebook. To start jupyter notebok type

```
jupyter notebook
```

and hit enter, it will open the notebook in the default browser.

Navigate to the location where you downloaded or cloned the repository and open the notebooks by clicking on them, the extension for jupyter notebooks is .ipynb
